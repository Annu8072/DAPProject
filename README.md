Abstract:

This data analysis project examines key football performance metrics—passing accuracy, possession, shot efficiency, and defensive actions—to identify winning patterns. Using historical match data and analytical techniques, it explores factors like team formations and player fatigue. The findings aim to enhance strategies, optimize training, and improve in-game decision-making.
